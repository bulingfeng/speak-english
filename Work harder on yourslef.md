## Work harder on yourslef

Everything <u>change</u> for me when I understood this philosophy.

Learn to work hard on yourself than you do on your job.

If you work harder on your job, you can make a living which is fine.

If you work hard on yourself, you can make a fortune which is super fine.

Success is somthing you attact.

Success is not something you pursue.

It's something you attract by becoming attractive.

If you can multiply your value by 3, by 5,  you can easily multiply your income by 3, by 5, by 10

But the key to doing it is to work hard on yourself.
